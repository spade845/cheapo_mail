Good Day,

I attempted this project on my own as you suggest. The database is poseted on cloud9. My log in is spade845@hotmail.com and password djimpyw1 . I am having trouble linking the php code to the database although 
the connect.php that runs in cloud9 tells me that the database is linked. The index.html page is the first on that should be run, afterwards if you enter a password and a password it takes you to the 
text page. This was in attept to get the password from the database but it doesnt link as i said before. 

Thank you for your time
